# SPNET
In this study, an end-to-end network (SP-Net) was developed to extract features from Biplane Radiographs to reconstruct the 3D structure of the spine. We also explored multiple configurations of the SP-Net in order to improve the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction of the spine. We defined evaluation metrics to compare with several classical 3D model evaluation methods.


Required environment:

python 3.6

keras 2.6.0

tensorflow 2.6.2


Dataset: 

Under the SP-net/dataset folder, there are two datasets, one for normal spine (normal) and one for scoliosis spine (scoliosis). We used 8 datasets in our paper, this is only a part of the data and we will continue to upload other data.

Dataset production: 

If you have CT data that is licensed for use, you can produce the same dataset as we did. the TIGRE toolbox is introduced in the paper "TIGRE: a MATLAB-GPU toolbox for CBCT image reconstruction" by Ander Biguri et al. and we refer to this work to produce dataset. The installation link for this toolbox is: https://gitee.com/qiangge_666/TIGRE/blob/master/Frontispiece/MATLAB_installation.md. Both python and matlab installation methods are used, and we used matlab.


Evaluation metrics: 

We propose DisE_algorithm and SAc_alogrithm to evaluate the accuracy of 3D reconstruction, and provide the pseudo-code of these two algorithms.


Data enhancement: 

We propose bone_feature_enhancement_algorithm to enhance data features, and provide python code and pseudo-code, as well as some image examples.


Training details:

1. Read the data. Use the new_try_to_read_image_and_csv.py in SP-net/code folder to read the data.
2. Train the model using train.py in the SP-net/code folder.
3.Use my_evaluation.py under SP-net/code folder to evaluate the model.
The SP-net/code/model folder contains various configurations we propose. To get more information please contact us (1240888547@qq.com). We will add links after the paper is published, so please follow us.
